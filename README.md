# Mission-to-Mars
The purpose of this project is to automate a web browser to visit different websites to extract data about the Mission to Mars.  The data is stored in a NoSQL database, and then rendered in a web application created with Flask. The final phase of the project is to pull the images of Mars’s hemispheres and adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. BeautifulSoup and Splinter are used to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
